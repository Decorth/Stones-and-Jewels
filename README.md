# Stones-and-Jewels

Was an exercise given at LeetCode.com, it was a quick exercise that I did to refresh my knowledge on strings.


What I learned:
- I learned that instead of using contains() for an object that isn't a character sequence, one should use indexOf and check if there is a non-negative value returned.


Expected time to solve: 5 minutes

Actual time: 3.5 minutes


You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
